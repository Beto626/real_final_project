<h1>Cash Carti</h1>
<p> He originally started rapping as Sir Cartier, releasing a mixtape named
   Young Misfit under the Sir Cartier moniker on November 12, 2012. He then
   later changed his name at the age of 17. Recording and performing under the
   alias Playboi Carti, he first came into prominence in 2015 with his song
    "Broke Boi". Initially a part of the Atlanta-based Awful Records label
    ,he also performed at the fashion events such as Yeezy Season 5, VFiles
     and Raf Simons events, with artists such as Lil Uzi Vert and ASAP Rocky
      In 2016, he was featured on ASAP Mob's debut studio album, Cozy Tapes
       Vol. 1: Friends, on the tracks "London Town" and "Telephone Calls",
       which the latter was released as the second single from the album.

Carti's eponymous debut mixtape, which features guest appearances from Lil
 Uzi Vert, ASAP Rocky, and Leven Kali, was released on April 14, 2017. The
 self-titled release gained attention from various music publications, including
  XXL, Pitchfork, Spin, HotNewHipHop and PopMatters. XXL noted the track
  "Magnolia" as a standout cut, whereas Pitchfork critic Briana Younger
   thought that the release "finds a cloudy and economical mood and stays
    there, but it's Carti's magnetic confidence that turns just enough into
     plenty." The mixtape sold 28,051 units in its opening week.

In accompaniment with the mixtape's release, Carti embarked a tour, which featured him as an opening act for Gucci Mane and Dreezy.</p>
<h2> Carti Season  </h2>
<P> Playboi carti just dropped his first mixtape ever. He has always
had a rapid growing fanbase , but now it is really on the rise
and his songs are making top of the charts. He recently had a concert at the Novo
in LA next to the staples center which I actually attended. The energy was very
strong and the moshpit was going up all night. It was so crazy that I even got
hit by a shoe out of no where. He also performed "Magnolia" which at the time it wasn't out yet.
He was happy because all the fans knew it and it wasn't even out.
There was a 30 second snippet released on soundcloud though.</p>
