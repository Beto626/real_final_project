    <h1>Lil Boat</h1>
    <p>Lil Yachty has had a lot of his music out for a while and he
      is one of my personal favorites.Lil Yachty calls his style "bubblegum trap." His songs have sampled sounds ranging from Mario Bros., Charlie Brown, the theme from Rugrats theme, and the startup sound of a GameCube console. Other themes in his works include clouds, cotton candy, the Super Nintendo, and scenes from Pixar films. His friend Burberry Perry is heavily involved in the production of his songs.

Rolling Stone described his music as "catchy, intentionally dinky-sounding tunes packed with off-color boasts delivered in a proudly amateurish singsong." The Guardian called his music "fun, hook-first pop rap oblivious to songcraft and structure that doesnâ€™t take itself too seriously, with very little interest in legacy and even less in rap canon."
